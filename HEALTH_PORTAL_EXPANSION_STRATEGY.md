## ⚠️ Risk Factors to Monitor

- **Scope Creep:** Building too many features too quickly → focus on Phase 1 first
- **Integration Delays:** Third-party APIs can be slow to approve → start partnership talks early
- **User Overwhelm:** Too many modules confusing → phased rollout with clear onboarding
- **Monetization Timing:** Premium paywall too early kills growth → generous free tier initially
- **Content Moderation:** Social features require moderation resources → plan for this cost
